## [Day 5: Doesn't He Have Intern-Elves For This?](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/5)
### Part 1
Santa needs help figuring out which strings in his text file are naughty or nice.

A **nice string** is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains at least three vowels (`aeiou` only), like `aei`, `xazegov`, or `aeiouaeiouaeiou`.
- It contains at least one letter that appears twice in a row, like `xx`, `abcdde` (`dd`), or `aabbccdd` (`aa`, `bb`, `cc`, or `dd`).
- It does not contain the strings `ab`, `cd`, `pq`, or `xy`, even if they are part of one of the other requirements.

For example:
- `ugknbfddgicrmopn` is nice because it has at least three vowels (`u...i...o...`), a double letter (`...dd...`), and none of the disallowed substrings.
- `aaa` is nice because it has at least three vowels and a double letter, even though the letters used by different rules overlap.
- `jchzalrnumimnmhp` is naughty because it has no double letter.
- `haegwjzuvuyypxyu` is naughty because it contains the string `xy`.
- `dvszwmarrgswjxmb` is naughty because it contains only one vowel.


#### 0. Load Puzzle input

```python
file = open('puzzle.aoc', 'r')
```

#### 1. Define rules

```python
def more_than_two_vowels(input):
    """Check if more than two vowels are in string"""
    vowels = input.count('a') + input.count('e') + input.count('i') + input.count('o') + input.count('u')
    return vowels > 2

def two_letters_in_a_row(input):
    """Check if one letter follows itself at least once"""
    prev = ''
    for current in input:
        if prev == current:
            return True
        prev = current
    return False

def does_not_contain_forbidden_seqs(input):
    """Does not contain 'ab', 'cd', 'pq' or 'xy'"""
    appearances = input.count('ab') + input.count('cd') + input.count('pq') + input.count('xy')
    return appearances == 0
```

### Task 1: How many strings are nice?


#### 2. Count nice strings

```python
nice_strings = 0

while True:
    line = file.readline()
 
    if more_than_two_vowels(line) and \
        two_letters_in_a_row(line) and \
        does_not_contain_forbidden_seqs(line):
        nice_strings += 1
        
    # if end of file is reached
    if not line:
        break
```

#### 3. Show nice Strings

```python
nice_strings
```

#### 4. Close file

```python
file.close()
```

### Part 2
#### 0. Load puzzle input

```python
file = open('puzzle.aoc', 'r')
```

Realizing the error of his ways, Santa has switched to a better model of determining whether a string is naughty or nice. None of the old rules apply, as they are all clearly ridiculous.

Now, a nice string is one with all of the following properties:

- It contains a pair of any two letters that appears at least twice in the string without overlapping, like `xyxy` (`xy`) or `aabcdefgaa` (`aa`), but not like `aaa` (`aa`, but it overlaps).
- It contains at least one letter which repeats with exactly one letter between them, like `xyx`, `abcdefeghi` (`efe`), or even `aaa`.

For example:
- `qjhvhtzxzqqjkmpb` is nice because is has a pair that appears twice (`qj`) and a letter that repeats with exactly one letter between them (`zxz`).
- `xxyxx` is nice because it has a pair that appears twice and a letter that repeats with one between, even though the letters used by each rule overlap.
- `uurcxstgmygtbstg` is naughty because it has a pair (`tg`) but no repeat with a single letter between them.
- `ieodomkazucvgmuy` is naughty because it has a repeating letter with one between (`odo`), but no pair that appears twice.


#### 1. Define new rules

```python
def pair_appears_twice(input):
    """Contains two appearances of pairs"""
    for i in range(len(input)):
        if input[i+2:].count(input[i:i+2]) > 0:
            return True
    return False

def pair_is_seperated(input):
    """Check if a pair is seperated through another character"""
    preprev = '\0'
    prev = ''
    for current in input:
        if preprev == current:
            return True
        preprev = prev
        prev = current
    return False
```

### Task 2: How many strings are nice under these new rules?


#### 2. Count nice strings

```python
nice_strings = 0

while True:
    line = file.readline()
 
    if pair_appears_twice(line) and \
        pair_is_seperated(line):
        nice_strings += 1
        
    # if end of file is reached
    if not line:
        break
```

#### 3. Show amount of nice strings

```python
nice_strings
```

#### 4. Close file

```python
file.close()
```
