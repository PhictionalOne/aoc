## [Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say](https://adventofcode.com/2015/day/10)

### Part 1
Today, the Elves are playing a game called [look-and-say](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence). They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, `211` is read as `"one two, two ones"`, which becomes `1221` (`1` `2`, `2` `1`s).

Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like `111`) with the number of digits (`3`) followed by the digit itself (`1`).

For example:

- `1` becomes `11` (`1` copy of digit `1`).
- `11` becomes `21` (`2` copies of digit `1`).
- `21` becomes `1211` (one `2` followed by one `1`).
- `1211` becomes `111221` (one `1`, one `2`, and two `1`s).
- `111221` becomes `312211` (three `1`s, two `2`s, and one `1`).

Starting with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process `40` times. 

### Task 1: What is the length of the result?

```kotlin
val puzzle = "3113322113"
val n = 40
```

```kotlin
var number = puzzle.first()
var count = 0

var sequence = puzzle
var seq : StringBuilder = StringBuilder("")

for (i in 0 until n) {
    number = sequence.first()
    count = 0
    for (c in sequence) {
        if (c == number) {
            count++
        } else {
            seq.append(count)
            seq.append(number)
            number = c
            count = 1
        }
    }
    seq.append(count)
    seq.append(number)
    sequence = seq.toString()
    seq = seq.deleteRange(0,seq.length)
    
    print("${i+1}:\t${sequence.length}\n")
}
```

#### Print length

```kotlin
sequence.length
```

```
329356
```


### Part 2
Neat, right? You might also enjoy hearing [John Conway talking about this sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea7lJkEhytA) (that's Conway of **Conway's Game of Life** fame).

Now, starting again with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process `50` times. 

### Task 2: What is the length of the new result?

```kotlin
val n = 50
```

#### Print length of 50th iteration

```kotlin
sequence.length
```

```
