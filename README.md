# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code Website](https://adventofcode.com/)

I strongly believe that no tool is perfect for every job. You wouldn't use a shovel for
carpenting. It works but definitely isn't optimal.

Because of that I will use whatever seems fit for the *AOC* Task at hand. Also I might use
odd language, tools as I might want to learn their use.

## Solved Puzzles
- [2015](2015/README.md)
- [2020](2020/README.md)

## Requirements
A multitude of things.

* Jupyter Notebooks with the Kernels `R`, `Python` and `Kotlin` might be found.
* A `C0` installation through the Docker Image
    [`dbatunituebingen/c0`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dbatunituebingen/c0) would be nice.
