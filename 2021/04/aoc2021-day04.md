# Day 4: Giant Squid

You're already almost 1.5km (almost a mile) below the surface of the ocean,
already so deep that you can't see any sunlight. What you **can** see, however,
is a giant squid that has attached itself to the outside of your submarine.

Maybe it wants to play bingo?

Bingo is played on a set of boards each consisting of a 5x5 grid of numbers.
Numbers are chosen at random, and the chosen number is **marked** on all boards
on which it appears. (Numbers may not appear on all boards.) If all numbers in
any row or any column of a board are marked, that board **wins**. (Diagonals
don't count.)

The submarine has a **bingo subsystem** to help passengers (currently, you and
the giant squid) pass the time. It automatically generates a random order in
which to draw numbers and a random set of boards (your puzzle input). 
For example:

```
7,4,9,5,11,17,23,2,0,14,21,24,10,16,13,6,15,25,12,22,18,20,8,19,3,26,1

22 13 17 11  0
 8  2 23  4 24
21  9 14 16  7
 6 10  3 18  5
 1 12 20 15 19

 3 15  0  2 22
 9 18 13 17  5
19  8  7 25 23
20 11 10 24  4
14 21 16 12  6

14 21 17 24  4
10 16 15  9 19
18  8 23 26 20
22 11 13  6  5
 2  0 12  3  7
```

After the first five numbers are drawn (`7`, `4`, `9`, `5`, and `11`), there
are no winners, but the boards are marked as follows (shown here adjacent to
each other to save space):

```
22  13  17  11*  0      3  15   0   2  22     14  21  17  24   4*
 8   2  23   4* 24      9* 18  13  17   5*    10  16  15   9* 19
21   9* 14  16   7*    19   8   7* 25  23     18   8  23  26  20
 6  10   3  18   5*    20  11* 10  24   4*    22  11* 13   6   5*
 1  12  20  15  19     14  21  16  12   6      2   0  12   3   7*
```

After the next six numbers are drawn (`17`, `23`, `2`, `0`, `14`, and `21`),
there are still no winners:

```
22  13  17* 11*  0*     3  15   0*  2* 22     14* 21* 17* 24   4*
 8   2* 23*  4* 24      9* 18  13  17*  5*    10  16  15   9* 19
21*  9* 14* 16   7*    19   8   7* 25  23*    18   8  23* 26  20
 6  10   3  18   5*    20  11* 10  24   4*    22  11* 13   6   5*
 1  12  20  15  19     14* 21* 16  12   6      2*  0* 12   3   7*
```

Finally, `24` is drawn:

```
22  13  17* 11*  0*     3  15   0*  2* 22     14* 21* 17* 24*  4*
 8   2* 23*  4* 24*     9* 18  13  17*  5*    10  16  15   9* 19
21*  9* 14* 16   7*    19   8   7* 25  23*    18   8  23* 26  20
 6  10   3  18   5*    20  11* 10  24*  4*    22  11* 13   6   5*
 1  12  20  15  19     14* 21* 16  12   6      2*  0* 12   3   7*
```

At this point, the third board **wins** because it has at least one complete
row or column of marked numbers (in this case, the entire top row is marked:
`14` `21` `17` `24` `4`).

The **score** of the winning board can now be calculated. Start by finding the
**sum of all unmarked numbers** on that board; in this case, the sum is 188.
Then, multiply that sum by **the number that was just called** when the board
won, `24`, to get the final score, `188 * 24 = `**`4512`**.

To guarantee victory against the giant squid, figure out which board will win
first. **What will your final score be if you choose that board?**

import Data.List

toInt :: String -> Int
toInt = (foldl (\xs x -> xs * 10 + x) 0) . (map (\x -> (fromEnum x -48)))

replace :: Eq a => a -> a -> [a] -> [a]
replace f t = map (\x -> if x == f then t else x)

  where buildBoards :: [String] -> [Board]
        buildBoards [] = []

        dropB = (dropWhile ((0 <) . length)) . tail

sampleBoard :: Board
sampleBoard = [ [( 1, False), (34, False), (23, False), ( 2, False)]
              , [( 4, False), ( 3, False), (23, False), ( 9, False)]
              , [(98, False), (45, False), ( 3, False), ( 2, False)]

                                    then (bingos, prev)
                                    else (map (mark x) bs, x)
          where bingos = filter isBingo bs


partOne :: String -> Int

  where puzzle  = lines input
        numbers = (parseCSV . head) puzzle
        boards  = (parseBoards . tail) puzzle

        (wins, lastCall) = play boards numbers
        sumOfUnmarked = sum . (map fst) . (filter (not . snd)) . (foldl (++) []) . head
```

## Part Two
On the other hand, it might be wise to try a different strategy: let the giant
squid win.

You aren't sure how many bingo boards a giant squid could play at once, so
rather than waste time counting its arms, the safe thing to do is to **figure
out which board will win last** and choose that one. That way, no matter which
boards it picks, it will win for sure.

In the above example, the second board is the last to win, which happens after
`13` is eventually called and its middle column is completely marked. If you
were to keep playing until this point, the second board would have a sum of
unmarked numbers equal to `148` for a final score of `148 * 13 = `**`1924`**.

Figure out which board will win last. **Once it wins, what would its final
score be?**

```haskell
-- I SHOULD MOST DEFINITELY REWRITE THIS
play2 :: [Board] -> [Int] -> ([Board], Int, (Board, Int))
play2 bs xs = foldl markAndSweep (bs, head xs, ([[(0, True)]],0)) xs
  where markAndSweep :: ([Board], Int, (Board, Int)) -> Int -> ([Board], Int, (Board, Int))
        markAndSweep (bs, prev, lb) x = (map (mark x) nobingos, x, lastBingo)
          where nobingos = filter (not . isBingo) bs
                lastBingo = let search = filter isBingo bs
                            in if ((0 <) . length) search
                               then (head search, prev)
                               else lb


partTwo :: String -> Int
partTwo input = sumOfUnmarked win * lastCall
  where puzzle  = lines input
        numbers = (parseCSV . head) puzzle
        boards  = (parseBoards . tail) puzzle

        (_, _, (win, lastCall)) = play2 boards numbers
        sumOfUnmarked = sum . (map fst) . (filter (not . snd)) . (foldl (++) [])
```

### Main

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  puzzle <- readFile "puzzle.aoc"
  print "What will your final score be if you choose that board?"
  print $ partOne puzzle
  print "Once it wins, what would its final score be?"
  print $ partTwo puzzle
```
